### PROJECT: Billing of travel expenses
## Travel expenses tracker
This is my app for __**Web programming**__ that is used for tracking, editing and approval of travel expenses in a firm. 

It will be used by: 
* __employee__
* __accountant__
* __manager__

### Workflow
Employee will file in the application for traveling, manager will either confirm or modify it. If the application is approved he will get the travel order.
After travelling he will have to file and prove all of the expenses. The accountant will then check the expenses and transfer spended money to employee account.

Manager, accountant and employee will all have **different permissions** to application, e.g. manager will have permission to whole application while employee can only see his 
travel history and pending travel apllications.

### Devices

It will be a web application, meaning it can be used on all devices supporting HTML5, e.g. computer, smartphones, tablets,...
